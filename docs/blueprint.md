- Accent color: Teal (#009688), as an accent to provide necessary contrast without overwhelming the UI.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines; body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for readability. 'Space Grotesk' provides a tech-forward, clean appearance that is also slightly playful.

- Use clear and simple icons for file types, actions (upload, download), and error indications.
- Subtle animations for upload and download progress, and code comparison highlighting.
